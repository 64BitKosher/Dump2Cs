#Dump2Cs
Dump2Cs is a command-line tool that automates the extraction of C# class definitions from a provided input file. The tool scans through the input file and identifies class blocks, generating individual C# files for each class found. It's particularly useful when you have a large source file containing multiple class definitions and you want to separate them into individual files for better organization.

**Features**
Automatically extracts C# class definitions from an input file.
Generates separate C# files for each class found.
Removes comments to improve code readability.
Provides a convenient command-line interface.
How to Use
Clone the repository or download the code.
Compile the code or run the application.
Provide the path to your input file (e.g., dump.cs) when prompted.
The tool will process the file and generate separate .cs files for each class found.
Example
Imagine you have a file named dump.cs containing multiple class definitions. Running the Dump2Cs tool on this file will automatically generate individual .cs files for each class, with cleaned code and improved organization.

**Usage Scenario**
You have a large code file containing multiple class definitions.
You want to split each class definition into its own separate file.
You want to remove comments to improve code readability.
You need an automated way to organize your class definitions.
Dump2Cs is designed to streamline this process and make managing class definitions more efficient.
